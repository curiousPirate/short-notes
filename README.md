# FRONT-END SHORT-NOTES

## Description

When we start learning something new like a language or a skill or anything, It can be overwhelming to be able to keep up with the knowledge and skills gained in the age of unlimited resources and information. But our human mind's potential is greater than what we expect. Having the information broken down into tiny bits of information, like formulas, bits of code, and images can immediately retrieve the memory containing what we learnt so far in a fraction of a second. 

This is the strategy helping me personally in every aspect of my learning curve. And now the project frontend learning would be beautifully designed with such short notes and hope this saves time and mental effort.

The goal of this website is to help with interview preparation and to refresh knowledge. Hope this helps and any feedback would be appreciated!
